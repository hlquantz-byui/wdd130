        Hello, my name is Hunter Quantz. I am working in the information
        technology field. I want to transition over to software development
        after completing my degree. I have tried a bunch of different hobbies
        and am always looking for new ones. I am also a big fan of privacy and
        am always looking for ways to increase my privacy online. I was impressed
        when I read a book called "Data and Goliath" by Bruce Schneier and have
        been cautious about what I upload to the internet ever since. This is
        especially true to sites owned by big companies such as Microsoft, Facebook,
        Google, and Apple. If you haven't read that book it is a great read that
        can really open your eyes to how much information we are giving away for
        companies to profit off of. I also think that we end up oversharing
        information in our daily lives that people end up forgetting unless it
        stands out in some big way.

        I am from the United States. The United States is divided into 50 states
        and several territories. It covers a large swath of the North American
        continent. It is one of the most populous countries on the planet with
        over 300 million citizens.
